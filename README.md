Main Idea:
-------------

Make a Social and Emotional learning application
</br>

</br>
The purpose of the application is to show people exercises that they have to go through in real life, and through these exercises it is possible for users to manage their emotions when necessary. The exercises and the original idea of the created application come from Liisa Ringo's master's thesis and Liisa Ringo's own experience working in this field.
